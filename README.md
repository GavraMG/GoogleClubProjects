Being an active member of the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) at the University of Guelph has been a transformative experience. Our chapter focuses on peer-to-peer learning and exploring the fundamentals of web development, particularly HTML and Firebase. This initiative is part of a collaborative effort to bolster students' technical acumen and provide a hands-on approach to learning Google's suite of technologies.
